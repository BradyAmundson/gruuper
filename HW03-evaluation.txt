Comments/feedback:

problem 7-1: nice to re-write the comments in English.  One thing to think
   about is are they really necessary?  The original has a comment for every
   line, which may be good for assembly but maybe not for this?

Otherwise, perfect!

Good job!!

It has been a great pleasure to have you folks in my classes over the years,
and I look forward to hearing from you as you make your marks upon the world
and the industry.  Keep up the good work!
